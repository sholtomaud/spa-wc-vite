## Critical Features for a Robust SPA

### Comprehensive State Management
- [ ] **Global Store:** Implement a centralized, reactive store for application-wide data.
  - [ ] Use a lightweight observable pattern or a simple custom event-based system.
  - [ ] Allow components to subscribe to changes in the global store.
- [ ] **Local Component State:** Define a clear pattern for managing state internal to specific Web Components.
  - [ ] Utilize properties or attributes for external data.
  - [ ] Implement internal reactive variables for component-specific state.
- [ ] **Two-Way Data Binding (Optional):** Explore a pattern for simpler form handling and updates between parent/child components to reduce boilerplate.

### Robust Error Handling and Logging
- [ ] **Global Error Boundaries/Catchers:** Implement a mechanism to catch unhandled errors at a higher level.
  - [ ] Utilize `window.onerror` and `window.onunhandledrejection`.
  - [ ] Consider a root component's error boundary pattern.
- [ ] **User-Friendly Error Messages:** Display clear and helpful messages to the user when something goes wrong (e.g., "Failed to load data," "Network error").
- [ ] **Logging:** Implement a mechanism for sending errors to a server-side logging service for proactive monitoring and debugging.
- [ ] **Loading/Error States for Data Fetching:** Explicitly show loading indicators and error messages when fetching data from an API.

### Authentication and Authorization
- [ ] **Login/Logout Flow:** Securely handle user credentials, issuing/refreshing tokens.
  - [ ] Consider using HTTP-only cookies for token storage.
- [ ] **Protected Routes:** Implement logic to redirect unauthenticated users from protected routes.
- [ ] **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement logic for showing/hiding UI elements or preventing actions based on the logged-in user's roles or permissions.
- [ ] **Secure Storage:** Carefully consider where to store tokens, prioritizing security.

### Data Fetching and Caching Strategy
- [ ] **Standardized API Service:** Create a centralized service or utility for making API requests.
  - [ ] Use `fetch` with sensible defaults.
  - [ ] Implement robust error handling.
  - [ ] Implement request/response interceptors.
- [ ] **Loading Indicators:** Visually inform the user when data is being fetched (spinners, skeleton loaders).
- [ ] **Caching Mechanisms:** Implement strategies to cache frequently accessed data to reduce redundant API calls.
  - [ ] Consider an in-memory cache.
  - [ ] Explore using `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` for certain data.
- [ ] **Revalidation/Invalidation:** Implement strategies for revalidating cached data when it might be stale or invalidating it after mutations.

### Accessibility (A11y) Best Practices
- [ ] **Semantic HTML:** Use appropriate HTML elements for their semantic meaning.
- [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** Correctly apply ARIA roles, states, and properties to custom components where native HTML doesn't provide sufficient semantics.
- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements are reachable and operable via keyboard.
- [ ] **Focus Management:** Properly manage focus when routing or updating parts of the UI.
- [ ] **Contrast Ratios:** Ensure sufficient color contrast for readability.
