# Vanilla Web Component SPA Framework Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the requirements for delivering a **fully functional Single Page Application (SPA) framework** built using **vanilla Web Components**. The goal is to produce an **enterprise-ready**, **production-quality**, and **progressive** architecture that serves as a foundation for modern web applications.

The solution will support:

- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- Modern development tooling (Vite, Vitest)
- GitHub Actions-based CI/CD for both the framework and example app
- Example application with good enterprise-grade UI/UX design
- Strong documentation and test coverage standards

## 2. Project Goals & Scope

### In Scope

- [ ] Native Web Component SPA framework
- [ ] Routing, state, and persistent storage built-in
- [ ] Fully working PWA example app
- [ ] Developer tooling: Vite, Vitest
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions for:
  - [ ] The framework
  - [ ] The example app
- [ ] Enterprise-ready CSS structure and styles
- [ ] Local dev environment documentation and setup
- [ ] Full test coverage (TDD-driven approach)
- [ ] Mandatory `JSDoc` for all exported functions and public methods

### Out of Scope

- ❌ React, Vue, Angular, Lit or other 3rd-party component frameworks
- ❌ Backend/API services (though stubs may be used in examples)

---

## 3. Core Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Component Architecture

- [x] Use Web Standards: ES Modules, Custom Elements API
- [ ] Shadow DOM encapsulation, scoped CSS
- [ ] Lifecycle-aware component composition

### 3.2 State Management

- [ ] Local and global reactive state modules
- [ ] Observer/subscriber pattern
- [ ] Support derived/computed state
- [ ] `JSDoc` documentation required

### 3.3 Persistent Storage

- [ ] LocalStorage/sessionStorage wrapper utilities
- [ ] Serialization, hydration, validation
- [ ] Optional schema support (JSON structure validation)

### 3.4 Routing System

- [ ] Hash or History API routing (configurable)
- [ ] Dynamic, nested routes
- [ ] Lazy-loading of components
- [ ] Route guards and 404 fallback

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance

- [ ] Initial load <2s (3G network)
- [ ] Tree-shakable build, target size <50KB gzipped
- [ ] Minimal dependency graph

### 4.2 Compatibility

- [ ] Fully functional in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Graceful fallback for older browser support

### 4.3 Maintainability

- [ ] Modular structure (src/components, src/state, etc.)
- [ ] `JSDoc` required for:
  - [ ] All exported functions
  - [ ] All modules and class methods
- [ ] GitHub Discussions or README for extension strategy (auth, themes, i18n, etc.)

---

## 5. Testing & Documentation

### 5.1 Testing

- [ ] Test-Driven Development (TDD) as workflow standard
- [ ] Use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) for:
  - [ ] Unit testing (components, utilities)
  - [ ] Integration testing (routing, storage)
- [ ] Code coverage >90%
- [ ] Test stubs/mocks for services
- [ ] CI pipeline fails if coverage thresholds are not met

### 5.2 Documentation

- [x] All modules and public interfaces must be documented with `JSDoc`
- [x] README files per major subdirectory
- [x] Auto-generate documentation with `jsdoc
- [x] A `docs/` directory to store the static output (optional)

---

## 6. Tooling & Build System

- [ ] Vite for dev server and production build
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier config for formatting
- [ ] Auto-reload with HMR in dev
- [ ] Source maps in production build

---

## 7. CI/CD Requirements

### 7.1 Framework CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

- [ ] Install dependencies
- [ ] Run tests and linting
- [ ] Build the framework
- [ ] Upload artifacts or deploy to npm/GitHub Pages

### 7.2 Example App CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

- [ ] Separate pipeline from core framework
- [ ] Build and deploy demo app to GitHub Pages (or Netlify)
- [ ] Auto-generate example documentation
- [ ] Cache node_modules, build output for faster runs

---

## 8. Example App Requirements

- [ ] Demonstrates routing, state, and storage
- [ ] Built using the provided Web Component framework
- [ ] Clean, maintainable layout with scalable design system
- [ ] Enterprise-grade CSS (prefer BEM or utility class hybrid)
- [ ] PWA support (manifest + service worker)
- [ ] App installability and offline behavior

---

## 9. Developer Onboarding & Environment Setup

- [ ] `README.md` for both the framework and example app
- [ ] Setup instructions:
  - [ ] Node version and package manager (e.g., npm, pnpm)
  - [ ] `npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npm test`
  - [ ] How to run the test suite locally
  - [ ] How to lint and format code
- [ ] Clear instructions for contributing, branching strategy, and CI behavior

---

## 10. Evaluation Criteria

- [ ] GitHub Actions pipelines run reliably and pass all steps
- [ ] Developer can clone repo, run the app locally in <5 min
- [ ] All core features (routing, state, storage) work independently
- [ ] Tests cover critical logic paths and run <5s
- [ ] JSDoc covers all major components and utilities
- [ ] Example app shows solid UI/UX and accessibility
