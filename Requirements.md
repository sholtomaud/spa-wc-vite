# LLM Delivery Requirements Document: SPA Enhancement Project

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities to enhance specific features within the existing Single Page Application (SPA). The goal is to leverage LLMs to improve user experience, streamline development, and provide intelligent functionalities where appropriate.

## 2. Project Goals & Scope (LLM Focus)

The primary goal is to empower the SPA with intelligent features and automated assistance, specifically focusing on:

- [ ] Generating relevant content or responses based on user input or application state.
- [ ] Assisting in development tasks by generating code snippets or documentation.
- [ ] Providing proactive insights or suggestions to users.

> ❌ **Out of Scope:** Full replacement of human-driven logic for core SPA functionalities. The LLM is an enhancement tool.

## 3. LLM Use Cases & Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Comprehensive State Management (LLM-Assisted Development & Documentation)

- [ ] State Definition Assistance  
  - Input: Natural language description of state.
  - Output: JSON schema / TypeScript interface.
  - Criteria: Syntactically correct, semantically relevant.

- [ ] Global Store Documentation Generation  
  - Input: Global store code or description.
  - Output: Markdown docs (purpose, variables, usage).
  - Criteria: Clear, accurate, formatted.

- [ ] Boilerplate Code Generation (Component State)  
  - Input: Component name + state summary.
  - Output: Web Component structure with getters/setters.
  - Criteria: Valid and reduces manual setup.

### 3.2. Robust Error Handling and Logging

- [ ] Error Message Generation (User-Facing)  
  - Input: Error code/context/tone.
  - Output: Friendly UI message.
  - Criteria: Non-technical, avoids sensitive info.

- [ ] Log Analysis and Suggestion (Developer-Facing)  
  - Input: Log snippet.
  - Output: Summary, possible causes, next steps.
  - Criteria: Relevant and actionable.

### 3.3. Authentication and Authorization (Knowledge & Best Practices)

- [ ] Security Best Practice Guidance  
  - Input: Query (e.g., token storage, JWT refresh).
  - Output: Best practices + tradeoffs.
  - Criteria: Up-to-date and context-relevant.

- [ ] RBAC Logic Generation (Conceptual)  
  - Input: Roles + permissions.
  - Output: Pseudocode or high-level diagram.
  - Criteria: Clarifies role-permission-UI linkages.

### 3.4. Data Fetching and Caching Strategy

- [ ] API Service Boilerplate Generation  
  - Input: Endpoint, method, sample data.
  - Output: Fetch wrapper with error handling.
  - Criteria: Runnable, reusable, minimal.

- [ ] Caching Strategy Recommendation  
  - Input: Data type, frequency, performance target.
  - Output: Cache method (e.g., `localStorage`, in-memory).
  - Criteria: Matches performance needs.

### 3.5. Accessibility (A11y) Best Practices

- [ ] Semantic HTML/ARIA Suggestion  
  - Input: HTML or component intent.
  - Output: A11y enhancements via HTML/ARIA.
  - Criteria: Valid and improves usability.

- [ ] Accessibility Guideline Explanation  
  - Input: Guideline query.
  - Output: Explanation and implementation advice.
  - Criteria: Clear and actionable.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Performance

- [ ] LLM response latency for developers < 5 seconds.
- [ ] LLM response latency for users < 2 seconds.
- [ ] LLM service supports concurrent requests without slowdowns.

### 4.2. Accuracy & Relevance

- [ ] Generated information must be at least 95% accurate.
- [ ] Outputs must be relevant to the SPA and context-aware.
- [ ] Responses for similar prompts should be stylistically consistent.

### 4.3. Data Privacy & Security

- [ ] No sensitive/PII data sent to LLM unless anonymized.
- [ ] No data retention after processing.
- [ ] All API communication must use HTTPS/TLS.

### 4.4. Ethical Considerations

- [ ] Apply bias mitigation strategies for user-facing outputs.
- [ ] Clearly label AI-generated content when displayed to users.
- [ ] Prevent generation of harmful/inappropriate output.

### 4.5. Maintainability & Scalability

- [ ] Set up a prompt versioning/management system.
- [ ] Define model update integration process.
- [ ] Ensure integration is scalable as demand grows.

## 5. Technical Requirements

- [ ] Use RESTful or gRPC API for LLM communication.
- [ ] Enforce API key or OAuth-based authentication.
- [ ] Implement fallback if LLM fails or is offline.
- [ ] Enable logging and monitoring of LLM interactions.
- [ ] Avoid large third-party LLM client libraries unless necessary.

## 6. Success Metrics & Evaluation

### Integration Success

- [ ] % of developer tasks aided by LLM.
- [ ] Reduced boilerplate time (via dev feedback).
- [ ] Better user feedback on error messages.

### Performance

- [ ] Average response time tracked for each feature.
- [ ] Code/suggestion accuracy based on developer review.
- [ ] User satisfaction surveys on LLM content.

### Security

- [ ] No data breaches or PII leaks.
- [ ] Verified adherence to privacy rules.

## 7. Open Questions / Dependencies

- [ ] Which LLM model (e.g., open-source vs. Gemini Pro)?
- [ ] How will LLM usage costs be tracked/controlled?
- [ ] What’s the fine-tuning and continual learning strategy?
- [ ] Where will human oversight be required for critical flows?
